# Part 1: My First Experience with LangChain

**Published: September 1, 2025**

## Introduction

I learned about the LangChain framework through a friend back in 2023. You know, that was the peak of the AI hype, especially with LLMs like ChatGPT and chatbots. In companies or businesses, everyone wanted to implement a chatbot to make their business look trendy and modern (even though they didn‚Äôt really know what a chatbot could actually do üôÇ). [This is a post of one of my mentor about this problem][viblo]

Besides that, I feel a ‚Äúgood‚Äù chatbot has many efficient applications, like coding, summarizing, etc., and I see LangChain as a good framework to build my own interactive chatbot. This isn‚Äôt a tutorial‚ÄîI‚Äôm just sharing my thoughts about this framework. And yeah, this is my first post, so I want to freely share my opinions. If you‚Äôre reading this, I hope you enjoy it.

## Why LangChain?

Besides LangChain, there are many frameworks you can use to interact with LLMs, like [Llama Index][llama-index]. But I chose LangChain because it is flexible to implement and code with. Although it can be complex and requires reading documentation, I like it because you can customize and extend it easily. Compared to Llama Index, I feel that framework is more like a black box‚Äîyou can use it easily without much implementation or coding.
