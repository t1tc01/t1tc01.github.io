    <h1>Part 1: My First Experience with LangChain</h1>

    <p class="published-date"><strong>Published: September 1, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>I learned about the LangChain framework through a friend back in 2023. You know, that was the peak of the AI hype, especially with LLMs like ChatGPT and chatbots. In companies or businesses, everyone wanted to implement a chatbot to make their business look trendy and modern (even though they didn't really know what a chatbot could actually do ðŸ™‚). <a href="https://viblo.asia/p/xin-dung-ngao-ai-ByEZkOPWZQ0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This is a post of one of my mentor about this problem</a></p>

    <p>Besides that, I feel a "good" chatbot has many efficient applications, like coding, summarizing, etc., and I see LangChain as a good framework to build my own interactive chatbot. This isn't a tutorialâ€”I'm just sharing my thoughts about this framework. And yeah, this is my first post, so I want to freely share my opinions. If you're reading this, I hope you enjoy it.</p>

    <h2>Why LangChain?</h2>

    <p>Besides LangChain, there are many frameworks you can use to interact with LLMs, like <a href="https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Llama Index</a>. But I chose LangChain because it is flexible to implement and code with. Although it can be complex and requires reading documentation, I like it because you can customize and extend it easily. Compared to Llama Index, I feel that framework is more like a black boxâ€”you can use it easily without much implementation or coding.</p>
