## Understanding the Command Pattern

With the **Command Pattern**, we can decouple objects that execute a certain task from the object that calls the method.

Let’s say we have an online food delivery platform. Users can place, track, and cancel orders.

```javascript
class OrderManager() {
  constructor() {
    this.orders = []
  }

  placeOrder(order, id) {
    this.orders.push(id)
    return `You have successfully ordered ${order} (${id})`;
  }

  trackOrder(id) {
    return `Your order ${id} will arrive in 20 minutes.`
  }

  cancelOrder(id) {
    this.orders = this.orders.filter(order => order.id !== id)
    return `You have canceled your order ${id}`
  }
}
```

On the `OrderManager` class, we have access to the `placeOrder`, `trackOrder` and `cancelOrder` methods. It would be totally valid JavaScript to just use these methods directly!

```javascript
const manager = new OrderManager();

manager.placeOrder("Pad Thai", "1234");
manager.trackOrder("1234");
manager.cancelOrder("1234");
```

However, there are downsides to invoking the methods directly on the `manager` instance. It could happen that we decide to rename certain methods later on, or the functionality of the methods change.

Say that instead of calling it `placeOrder`, we now rename it to `addOrder!` This would mean that we would have to make sure that we don’t call the `placeOrder` method anywhere in our codebase, which could be very tricky in larger applications. Instead, we want to decouple the methods from the `manager` object, and create separate command functions for each command!

Let’s refactor the `OrderManager` class: instead of having the `placeOrder`, `cancelOrder` and `trackOrder` methods, it will have one single method: `execute`. This method will execute any command it’s given.

Each command should have access to the `orders` of the manager, which we’ll pass as its first argument.

```javascript
class OrderManager {
  constructor() {
    this.orders = [];
  }

  execute(command, ...args) {
    return command.execute(this.orders, ...args);
  }
}
```

**We need to create three `Commands` for the order manager:**
- `PlaceOrderCommand`
- `TrackOrderCommand`
- `CancelOrderCommand`  

```javascript
class Command {
  constructor(execute) {
    this.execute = execute;
  }
}

function PlaceOrderCommand(order, id) {
  return new Command((orders) => {
    orders.push(id);
    return `You have successfully ordered ${order} (${id})`;
  });
}

function CancelOrderCommand(id) {
  return new Command((orders) => {
    orders = orders.filter((order) => order.id !== id);
    return `You have canceled your order ${id}`;
  });
}

function TrackOrderCommand(id) {
  return new Command(() => `Your order ${id} will arrive in 20 minutes.`);
}
```

Perfect! Instead of having the methods directly coupled to the `OrderManager` instance, they’re now separate, decoupled functions that we can invoke through the `execute` method that’s available on the `OrderManager`.

```javascript
class OrderManager {
  constructor() {
    this.orders = [];
  }

  execute(command, ...args) {
    return command.execute(this.orders, ...args);
  }
}

class Command {
  constructor(execute) {
    this.execute = execute;
  }
}

function PlaceOrderCommand(order, id) {
  return new Command(orders => {
    orders.push(id);
    console.log(`You have successfully ordered ${order} (${id})`);
  });
}

function CancelOrderCommand(id) {
  return new Command(orders => {
    orders = orders.filter(order => order.id !== id);
    console.log(`You have canceled your order ${id}`);
  });
}

function TrackOrderCommand(id) {
  return new Command(() =>
    console.log(`Your order ${id} will arrive in 20 minutes.`)
  );
}

const manager = new OrderManager();

manager.execute(new PlaceOrderCommand("Pad Thai", "1234"));
manager.execute(new TrackOrderCommand("1234"));
manager.execute(new CancelOrderCommand("1234"));
```

**Output:**

```bash
You have successfully ordered Pad Thai (1234)
Your order 1234 will arrive in 20 minutes.
You have canceled your order 1234
```

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- **Decoupling**: The command pattern decouples the object that invokes the operation from the object that knows how to perform it.
- **Flexibility**: You can easily add new commands without changing the existing code.
- **Undo Operations**: You can implement undo operations by storing the state of the object before executing the command.

### Cons

- **Complexity**: The command pattern can introduce a lot of classes and objects, which can make the code more complex.
- **Performance**: The command pattern can introduce a performance overhead because of the additional objects and method calls.
