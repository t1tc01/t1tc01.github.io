# Design System - Part 1: DragonflyDB / Redis - Which Is the Best Caching Service?

When looking to choose a caching service, DragonflyDB and Redis are two major contenders. Below is a clear comparison to help understand their differences.

## Architecture / Performance

| Feature | DragonflyDB | Redis |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Architecture | Multi-threaded, sharded per CPU core | Single-threaded event loop |
| Throughput | Up to 25x higher under load | High but limited by single-thread bottleneck |
| Latency | Lower latency, better during heavy usage | Low latency but higher variation |
| Scalability | Vertical scaling on single instance | Requires clusters for scaling |
| Memory efficiency | Optimized snapshotting and memory use | Efficient but snapshotting blocks operations |

You can see detail of benchmarking here: [https://www.dragonflydb.io/docs/getting-started/benchmark](https://www.dragonflydb.io/docs/getting-started/benchmark)

## Ecosystem / Usability

| Aspect | DragonflyDB | Redis |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| API Compatibility | Drop-in Redis compatible | Original Redis API |
| Community & Tools | Growing rapidly but smaller ecosystem | Large, mature, extensive ecosystem |
| Maintenance | Easier scaling, fewer cluster complexities | More complex cluster setup and management |

# Install dragonflydb

## Install with docker (On Linux)

```bash
docker run --network=host --ulimit memlock=-1 docker.dragonflydb.io/dragonflydb/dragonfly
```

## Docker compose

```bash
# Download Official Dragonfly Docker Compose File
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dragonflydb/dragonfly/main/contrib/docker/docker-compose.yml
# Launch the Dragonfly Instance
docker compose up -d
# Confirm image is up
docker ps | grep dragonfly
# ac94b5ba30a0   docker.dragonflydb.io/dragonflydb/dragonfly   "entrypoint.sh drago…"   45 seconds ago   Up 31 seconds         0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp, :::6379->6379/tcp   docker_dragonfly_1
# Log follow the dragonfly container
docker logs -f docker_dragonfly_1
```

# Implement dragonflydb

DragonflyBD adapt with RedisClient, so you can implement this same as implementing redis.

## Summary

DragonflyDB is a modern design optimized for concurrency and multi-core performance, making it ideal for high throughput, low latency caching. Redis, while single-threaded, is trusted for its mature tooling, massive community, and robust ecosystem, but scaling can be more complex.

For new systems prioritizing speed and simplified vertical scaling, DragonflyDB is the best fit. For applications requiring proven tools and community support, Redis remains a reliable choice.

This comparison can serve as the first part in a technical blog series on design systems, guiding readers through selecting the best caching technology to meet their project needs.
